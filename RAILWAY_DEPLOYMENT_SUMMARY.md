# Histora Railway Deployment Summary

This document summarizes the configuration and steps needed to deploy the Histora application to Railway with database support.

## Configuration Status

✅ **All required files for Railway deployment are in place:**
- [railway.json](file:///Users/hientranpc/Desktop/Claude/histora/railway.json) - Build and deployment configuration
- [Procfile](file:///Users/hientranpc/Desktop/Claude/histora/Procfile) - Application start command
- [requirements.txt](file:///Users/hientranpc/Desktop/Claude/histora/requirements.txt) - Python dependencies
- [runtime.txt](file:///Users/hientranpc/Desktop/Claude/histora/runtime.txt) - Python version specification
- [railway_start.py](file:///Users/hientranpc/Desktop/Claude/histora/railway_start.py) - Simple startup script for Railway deployment

## Key Features

1. **Automatic Database Initialization**: The application automatically creates database tables when deployed to Railway
2. **Environment Variable Support**: Properly configured to use Railway's environment variables
3. **PORT Configuration**: Uses Railway's PORT environment variable for dynamic port assignment
4. **Health Check Endpoint**: `/health` endpoint for monitoring application status
5. **Railway-Native Dependency Management**: Relies on Railway's NIXPACKS builder to automatically install dependencies

## Deployment Steps

1. **Connect GitHub Repository to Railway**
   - Create a new Railway project
   - Connect your Histora GitHub repository
   - Railway will automatically detect it as a Python application

2. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - Go to your Railway project → Settings → Variables
   - Add all required environment variables (see [RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](file:///Users/hientranpc/Desktop/Claude/histora/RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) for details)

3. **Add PostgreSQL Database**
   - In your Railway project, click "+ New" → "Database" → "PostgreSQL"
   - Railway will automatically provision and connect the database

4. **Deploy Application**
   - Railway will automatically start deploying your application
   - Monitor progress in the "Deployments" tab

5. **Create Admin User (Optional)**
   - After deployment, use the Railway console to create an admin user:
     ```bash
     python backend/create_admin.py
     ```

## Database Configuration

The application is configured to:
- Automatically use the DATABASE_URL environment variable provided by Railway
- Create all necessary database tables on first deployment through the startup script
- Handle connection pooling and cleanup properly

## Environment Variables Required

Ensure these variables are set in your Railway project:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<railway-db-user>:<railway-db-password>@<railway-db-host>:<railway-db-port>/<railway-db-name>
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=<your-firebase-project-id>
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=<your-firebase-private-key>
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=<your-firebase-client-email>
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=<your-openrouter-api-key>
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
JWT_SECRET_KEY=<your-jwt-secret-key>
ADMIN_API_KEY=<your-admin-api-key>
ENVIRONMENT=production
BACKEND_URL=<your-railway-app-url>
```

## Verification

After deployment, verify the application is working:

1. Check the health endpoint:
   ```bash
   curl https://<your-railway-app-url>/health
   ```

2. Access the API documentation:
   ```bash
   curl https://<your-railway-app-url>/docs
   ```

## Support

For deployment issues:
1. Check Railway logs in your project's "Logs" tab
2. Verify all environment variables are correctly set
3. Ensure your Railway account has sufficient resources

The application is now ready for deployment to Railway with full database support and automatic dependency management!
